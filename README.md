# 100DaysOfCode-Projects


26/01/2023 I signed up for the "100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023" online course taught by Angela Yu on Udemy.
I will use this repo to store the solutions (and the possible changes to them) to the practical projects and excersises that will be proposed during the course. :D
